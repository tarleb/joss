**:warning: JOSS reduced service mode :warning:**

Due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, JOSS is currently operating in a "reduced service mode". You can read more about what that means in [our blog post](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2020/05/reopening-joss).

**Reviewers and authors**:

Please avoid lengthy details of difficulties in the review thread. Instead, please create a new issue in the <a href="<%= paper.repository_url %>" target="_blank">target repository</a> and link to those issues (especially acceptance-blockers) by leaving comments in the review thread below. (For completists: if the target issue tracker is also on GitHub, linking the review thread in the issue or vice versa will create corresponding breadcrumb trails in the link target.)

## Reviewer instructions & questions

<%= reviewers.join(' & ').html_safe %>, your review will be checklist based. Each of you will have a separate checklist that you should update when carrying out your review.
First of all you need to run this command in a separate comment to create the checklist:

```
@whedon generate my checklist
```

The reviewer guidelines are available here: https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html. Any questions/concerns please let <%= editor %> know.

✨ **Please start on your review when you are able, and be sure to complete your review in the next six weeks, at the very latest** ✨
